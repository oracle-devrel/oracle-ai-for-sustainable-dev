This Interactive AI Holograms exhibit uses Oracle AI services such as Speech AI as well as Oracle Database Select AI and Vector Search features, either directly or via the Oracle AI Optimizer and Toolkit.
It takes your spoken questions, conducts vector searches, and I, an Unreal Metahuman, provide the answers verbal and/or via data visualizations.
It is completely open source and available for you to try.
Thanks for checking it out.
